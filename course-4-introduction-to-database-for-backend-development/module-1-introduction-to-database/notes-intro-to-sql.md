# What is structured query language?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standard language for interacting with databases. SQL can be used to create, read, update, and delete data in a database.

## CRUD operations

The four basic operations that can be performed on data using SQL are:

- Create: Create a new record in a database table.
- Read: Retrieve data from a database table.
- Update: Modify data in a database table.
- Delete: Remove data from a database table.

## Relational databases

SQL is most commonly used with relational databases. Relational databases store data in tables, which are made up of rows and columns. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a single piece of data about that record.

## Database Management Systems (DBMS)

A database management system (DBMS) is software that allows users to create, manage, and access databases. When you use SQL to interact with a database, you are actually interacting with the DBMS. The DBMS takes your SQL instructions and translates them into commands that the database can understand.

# SQL usage

SQL is a language used to interact with databases. It can be used to perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete) on data, as well as other tasks such as defining data structures and controlling access to data.

SQL can be divided into four sub languages:

- Data Definition Language (DDL) is used to define data structures, such as tables and columns.
- Data Manipulation Language (DML) is used to manipulate data, such as inserting, updating, and deleting rows.
- Data Query Language (DQL) is used to retrieve data from tables.
- Data Control Language (DCL) is used to control access to data, such as granting and revoking permissions.

Here is a brief explanation of each sub language:

- **DDL**
  - `CREATE` - creates a new data structure, such as a table.
  - `ALTER` - modifies an existing data structure.
  - `DROP` - deletes a data structure.
- **DML**
  - `INSERT` - inserts a new row into a table.
  - `UPDATE` - updates an existing row in a table.
  - `DELETE` - deletes a row from a table.
- **DQL**
  - `SELECT` - retrieves data from a table.
  - `JOIN` - combines data from two or more tables.
  - `WHERE` - filters the results of a query.
- **DCL**
  - `GRANT` - gives a user permission to access data.
  - `REVOKE` - removes a user's permission to access data.

These are just a few of the many commands that can be used in SQL. For more information, please refer to the [SQL documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/).

In the context of the college database scenario, the DDL sub language could be used to create the tables that will store the data about the college. The DML sub language could be used to insert, update, and delete data from these tables. The DQL sub language could be used to retrieve data from the tables. And the DCL sub language could be used to control who has access to the data.

# Advantages of SQL

SQL is a popular language choice for databases because of the many advantages that it offers. Here are some of the most important advantages of SQL:

- **Simple:** SQL is a relatively simple language to learn. It is based on English keywords, so it is easy to understand for non-technical users.
- **Standard:** SQL is a standard language, which means that it is supported by all major relational databases. This makes it easy to move data between databases and to share code across different projects.
- **Portable:** SQL code can be run on any computer that has a database management system (DBMS) installed. This makes it a versatile language that can be used in a variety of environments.
- **Comprehensive:** SQL covers all aspects of database management, from creating and managing databases to querying and manipulating data. This makes it a powerful tool for working with relational databases.
- **Efficient:** SQL is a very efficient language for processing large amounts of data. This makes it ideal for applications that need to access and analyze large datasets.

These are just some of the many advantages of SQL. If you are looking for a language to work with relational databases, SQL is a great choice.

Here are some specific examples of how the advantages of SQL can be used to assist with database tasks:

- The simplicity of SQL makes it easy for non-technical users to create and manage databases.
- The standard nature of SQL makes it easy to move data between databases and to share code across different projects.
- The portability of SQL means that it can be used on any computer that has a DBMS installed.
- The comprehensiveness of SQL means that it can be used to perform all aspects of database management.
- The efficiency of SQL means that it can be used to process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.

Overall, SQL is a powerful and versatile language that can be used to work with relational databases. Its advantages make it a popular choice for developers and database administrators.

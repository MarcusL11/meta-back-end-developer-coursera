# Database tables

A database table is a collection of data organized in rows and columns. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a single piece of data about that record.

- **Rows:** A row is a single record in a table. It is also known as a tuple or a record.
- **Columns:** A column is a single piece of data about each record in a table. It is also known as an attribute or a field.

For example, a table of employees might have the following columns:

- ID
- Name
- Role
- Department
- Salary

Each row in this table would represent a single employee, and each column would contain a piece of data about that employee, such as their ID, name, role, department, and salary.

The data in a table can be of different data types, such as strings, numbers, dates, and Boolean values. The data type of each column is defined when the table is created.

The primary key is a column that uniquely identifies each row in a table. No two rows in a table can have the same value in the primary key column.

The foreign key is a column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. The foreign key column can be used to relate the two tables together.

Database tables are a fundamental concept in database design. They provide a way to organize data in a logical and efficient way.

Here are some of the benefits of using database tables:

- Data is organized in a logical way, which makes it easy to find and retrieve.
- Data can be shared between different users and applications.
- Data can be easily backed up and restored.
- Data can be protected from unauthorized access.

If you are working with a database, it is important to understand how tables work. Tables are the foundation of database design, and they provide a way to organize data in a logical and efficient way.

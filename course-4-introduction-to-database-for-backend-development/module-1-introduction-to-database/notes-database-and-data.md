# Notes on Database and Data

# How is data releated?

- Data in a database should be related so that it can be processed into meaningful information.
- The database establishes a link between the data in the tables by using a field that contains only unique values, called the primary key field.
- The customer ID is the primary key of the customer table, but it becomes a foreign key in the order table.
- The foreign key field in the order table helps to identify who placed the order.
- By adding the customer ID field to the order table, a relationship is established between the customer table and the order table.
- This relationship allows you to pull data in a meaningful way from both tables.
- Entity: A real-world object or concept that is represented in a database. For example, a customer is an entity in the online store database.
- Record: A row in a table that represents a single instance of an entity. For example, the row in the customer table with the customer ID of C1 is a record that represents the customer Sarah Hogan.
- Field: A column in a table that stores a single piece of data about an entity. For example, the Customer ID field in the customer table stores the unique identifier for each customer.
- Relationship: A connection between two tables that allows you to relate the data in the tables. For example, the relationship between the customer table and the order table is established by the customer ID field.

# Alternative types of data

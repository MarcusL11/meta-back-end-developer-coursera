# Relationships

## One-to-One relationship

If a primary key is in one model, and only one record exists in the other related model, the two models are said to have a one-to-one relationship.

Let's use an example of a college model and a principal model. A college can have only one principal or it can be similarly phrased as one person can be a principal of only one college.

The college model can be described as follows:

```py
class college(Model):
    CollegeID = models.IntegerField(primary_key = True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    strength = models.IntegerField()
    website=models.URLField()
```

In the principal model, you must provide the CollegeID field as the foreign key. The on_delete option specifies the behavior in case the associated object in the primary model is deleted. The values are:

- `CASCADE`: deletes the object containing the ForeignKey
- `PROTECT`: Prevent deletion of the referenced object.
- `RESTRICT`: Prevent deletion of the referenced object by raising RestrictedError

The principal model has the following field structure:

```py
class Principal(models.Model):
    CollegeID = models.OneToOneField(
                College,
                on_delete=models.CASCADE
                )
    Qualification = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=50)
```

When you run a migration on these models, respective tables are created with equivalent SQL queries:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "myapp_college" (
    "CollegeID" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    "strength" integer NOT NULL,
    "website" varchar(200) NOT NULL
    );

CREATE TABLE "myapp_principal" (
    "id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    "Qualification" varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    "email" varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    "CollegeID_id" integer NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES
    "myapp_college" ("CollegeID") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED
    );
```

## One to Many Relationship

In a One-to-Many relationship, one object of a model can be associated with one or more objects of another model. For example, a teacher is qualified to teach a subject, but there can be more than one teacher in a college who teaches the same subject.

Example:

```py
class Subject(models.Model):
    Subjectcode = models.IntegerField(primary_key = True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    credits = model.IntegerField()

```

The teacher model has its own primary key. It has a Foreignkey relating this model with the subject model.

```py
class Teacher(models.Model):
    TeacherID = models.ItegerField(primary_key=True)
    subjectcode=models.ForeignKey(
                Subject,
                on_delete=models.CASCADE
                  )
    Qualification = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=50)

```

The following SQL queries will be executed when you run the migration:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "myapp_subject" (
    "Subjectcode" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "credits" integer NOT NULL,
    "Qualification" varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    "email" varchar(50) NOT NULL
);


CREATE TABLE "myapp_teacher" (
    "TeacherID" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "Qualification" varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    "email" varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    "subjectcode_id" integer NOT NULL
    REFERENCES "myapp_subject" ("Subjectcode") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED
    );

CREATE INDEX "myapp_teacher_subjectcode_id_bef86dea" ON "myapp_teacher" ("subjectcode_id");
```

## Many to many relationship

In a Many-to-Many relationship, multiple objects of one model can be associated with multiple objects of another model.

Let's redefine the relationship between the subject and teacher models in the above example. If more than one teacher can teach the same subject, a single teacher can teach more than one subject. So, there is a Many-to-Many relationship between the two. Django implements this with a Many-to-Many Field type. Letâ€™s use it in the subject model.

The teacher model is straightforward.

```py
class Teacher(models.Model):
    TeacherID = models.ItegerField(primary_key=True)
    Qualification = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=50)
```

The design of the Subject model class reflects the Many-to-Many relationship.

```py
class Subject(models.Model):
    Subjectcode = models.IntegerField(primary_key = True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    credits = model.IntegerField()
    teacher = model.ManyToManyField(Teacher)
```

When the migrations are done, the following SQL queries will be executed to establish a many-to-many relationship.

```sql
CREATE TABLE "myapp_teacher" (
    "TeacherID" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "Qualification" varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    "email" varchar(50) NOT NULL
    );

CREATE TABLE "myapp_subject" (
    "Subjectcode" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "credits" integer NOT NULL
    );

CREATE TABLE "myapp_subject_teacher" (
    "id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    "subject_id" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "myapp_subject" ("Subjectcode") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED,
    "teacher_id" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "myapp_teacher" ("TeacherID") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "myapp_subject_teacher_subject_id_teacher_id_9b6a3c00_uniq" ON "myapp_subject_teacher" ("subject_id", "teacher_id");

CREATE INDEX "myapp_subject_teacher_subject_id_e87c76e7" ON "myapp_subject_teacher" ("subject_id");
```

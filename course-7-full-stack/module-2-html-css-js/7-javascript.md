# Variable

# Understanding Variables in JavaScript

- **JavaScript as a Sandbox**:

  - Blank canvas to build upon
  - Structure allows custom JavaScript code

- **Variable Introduction**:

  - **Importance of Variables**:
    - Foundation for building and reusing values
  - **Demonstration in Browser**:
    - Developer Tools panel for coding

- **Variable Declaration**:

  - **Keyword "var"**:
    - Signaling JavaScript about reusable value
  - **Declaring Variables**:
    - Example: `var person;`

- **Variable Assignment**:

  - **Assignment Operator (=)**:
    - Assigning a value to a variable
  - Example: `var person = "John";`

- **Utilizing Assigned Variables**:

  - **Console Output**:
    - Using `console.log` for outputting values
    - Combining static text with dynamic variables

- **Multiple Variable Usage**:

  - **Reassigning Variables**:
    - Altering stored values for variables
  - Demonstrating change: `greeting = "hi"; person = "James";`

- **Dynamic Code Results**:

  - **Changing Variable Values**:
    - Running the same code with different results
  - **Versatility of Variables**:
    - Ability to produce varied outcomes from the same code

- **Summary**:

  - **Importance of Variables**:
    - Enables versatility in programming
    - Key to producing different outcomes from the same code
  - **Fundamental Understanding**:
    - Basics of creating and manipulating variables in JavaScript

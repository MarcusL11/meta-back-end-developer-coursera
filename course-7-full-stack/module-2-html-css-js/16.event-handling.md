## JavaScript Event Listeners

**What are event listeners?**

Event listeners are functions that are triggered when a specific event occurs on a web page. Events can be anything from a user clicking a button to the page loading.

**How to use event listeners**

There are two ways to add event listeners to elements in JavaScript:

- **Using the addEventListener() method:** The `addEventListener()` method allows you to add an event listener to any element in the DOM. To do this, you simply call the `addEventListener()` method on the element and pass it the event type and the event handler function.
- **Using HTML event attributes:** HTML event attributes allow you to add event listeners to elements directly in the HTML code. To do this, you simply add the event name as an attribute to the element and pass the event handler function as the value of the attribute.

**Example:**

The following code demonstrates how to add an event listener to a button using the `addEventListener()` method:

```javascript
// Get a reference to the button element.
const button = document.querySelector("button");

// Add an event listener to the button element.
button.addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
});
```

The following code demonstrates how to add an event listener to a button using an HTML event attribute:

```html
<button onclick="console.log('Button clicked!');">Button</button>
```

**When to use event listeners**

Event listeners are a powerful way to interact with web pages dynamically. You can use event listeners to create interactive elements, such as buttons and menus, and to respond to user actions, such as mouse clicks and keyboard presses.

**Conclusion**

Event listeners are an essential tool for any JavaScript developer. By understanding how to use event listeners, you can create more dynamic and interactive web pages.

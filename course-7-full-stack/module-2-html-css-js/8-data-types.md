## JavaScript Primitive Data Types

**What are primitive data types?**

Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data in JavaScript. They are used to store simple values such as numbers, strings, and booleans. There are seven primitive data types in JavaScript:

- String: A sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
- Number: A numeric value, such as 10, 3.14, or -5.
- Boolean: A truth value, either true or false.
- Null: A special value that represents the absence of a value.
- Undefined: A special value that represents a variable that has not yet been assigned a value.
- BigInt: A large integer value.
- Symbol: A unique identifier value.

**When to use each primitive data type**

Each primitive data type has its own specific use case. Here are some general guidelines:

- Use strings to store text values, such as names, descriptions, and titles.
- Use numbers to store numeric values, such as prices, quantities, and distances.
- Use booleans to store truth values, such as whether a user is logged in or whether a form has been validated.
- Use null to represent the absence of a value.
- Use undefined to represent a variable that has not yet been assigned a value.
- Use BigInts to store large integer values.
- Use Symbols to create unique identifiers.

**Example:**

```javascript
// String
const name = "John Doe";

// Number
const price = 375;

// Boolean
const isLoggedIn = true;

// Null
const emptyVariable = null;

// Undefined
let undefinedVariable;

// BigInt
const bigInt = 12345678901234567890n;

// Symbol
const symbol = Symbol("unique identifier");
```

**Conclusion**

Understanding the different primitive data types in JavaScript is essential for writing efficient and effective code. By choosing the right data type for each value, you can make your code more readable, maintainable, and performant.

## JavaScript Operators

**What are operators?**

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. They are used to manipulate individual data items and return a result. For example, you can use operators to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. You can also use operators to compare values and determine if they are equal, greater than, or less than.

**Types of operators**

There are many different types of operators in JavaScript. Some common types of operators include:

- **Arithmetic operators:** These operators are used to perform arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Comparison operators:** These operators are used to compare values and determine if they are equal, greater than, or less than.
- **Logical operators:** These operators are used to combine two or more logical expressions and return a single logical value.

**Examples:**

```javascript
// Arithmetic operators
console.log(2 + 2); // 4
console.log(10 - 5); // 5
console.log(3 * 4); // 12
console.log(20 / 5); // 4

// Comparison operators
console.log(3 > 2); // true
console.log(2 > 3); // false
console.log(10 == 10); // true
console.log(10 != 10); // false

// Logical operators
console.log(true && false); // false
console.log(true || false); // true
console.log(!true); // false
```

**Conclusion**

Operators are an essential part of JavaScript programming. By understanding how to use operators, you can write more efficient and effective code.

**Additional information from the video:**

- **Comments:** Comments are used to specify which lines JavaScript should ignore. You can put almost anything inside comments.
- **Arithmetic and comparison operators:** You can use arithmetic and comparison operators to perform simple arithmetic and compare values.
- **Logical operators:** Logical operators are used to determine if something is true or false.
- **Flow of a program:** Operators can be used to control the flow of a program, so that it meets certain criteria.

## JavaScript Number Data Type

**What is the number data type?**

The number data type in JavaScript is used to represent both integer and decimal point numbers. It is a foundational part of JavaScript as a programming language, as it is used in many different areas of programming, such as mathematics, logic, and data structures.

**How to use the number data type**

To use the number data type in JavaScript, you simply type the value of the number you want to represent. For example, to represent the integer 123, you would type `123`. To represent the decimal number 123.456, you would type `123.456`.

**Mathematical operators**

You can use mathematical operators to perform arithmetic operations on numbers. Some common mathematical operators in JavaScript include:

- `+`: Addition
- `-`: Subtraction
- `*`: Multiplication
- `/`: Division
- `%`: Modulus (remainder)

**Examples:**

```javascript
// Addition
console.log(1 + 2); // 3

// Subtraction
console.log(4 - 2); // 2

// Multiplication
console.log(2 * 4); // 8

// Division
console.log(16 / 4); // 4

// Modulus
console.log(9 % 8); // 1
```

**Order of operations**

When performing multiple mathematical operations on an expression, JavaScript follows a specific order of operations. The order of operations is as follows:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division
4. Addition and Subtraction

For example, in the expression `2 * 4 + 8`, the multiplication is performed first, followed by the addition. This means that the expression evaluates to 16, not 24.

**Conclusion**

The number data type is one of the most important data types in JavaScript. It is used to represent both integer and decimal point numbers, and it can be used to perform a variety of mathematical operations. By understanding how to use the number data type, you can write more efficient and effective JavaScript code.

**Additional information from the video:**

- **Parentheses:** Parentheses can be used to group more complex calculations and control the order of calculations.
- **Exponential calculations:** The double star sign can be used to perform exponential calculations.
- **Remainder operator:** The remainder operator, or modulus operator, can be used to check how many times one number fits into another and return the remainder.
